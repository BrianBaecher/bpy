Issues:
  Obviously very dark, but that's a blender fix, not due to the scripts.

  Particle effect seems to jitter when other versions of it are initiated. 
    may be just due to the length of the particle system's lifespan. Try changing that to an unreasonably high number so the particles don't reset/vanish at any point during an 
    animation.

  code is a mess, so fix that...
